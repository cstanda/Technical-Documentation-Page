                <p>Online trading invloes the buying and selling of financial securities such as currencies, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc through internet based systems with the intention to make profits.</p>
                <p>Before the introduction of electronic interfaces, trading was mainly conducted through face-to-face interactions as traders would gather at different trading floors such as the New York or Nairobi Stock Exchange in order to execute trades in real time. Traders were also able to place orders through mail or fax which meant that trade executions would take longer. Newspapers and Financial Bulletins were used as sources for market news which lead to slow access to important market data in order to make decisions.</p>
                <p>Internet based systems allow traders to access different markets any time from anywhere in the world and also allow real time access of data in order to make timely decisions. Many platforms have been created and proide traders with many features such as analytical tools, educational resources, trading algorithms and bots</p>

                <p>A trading strategy is a set of rules that a trader applies in making trade decisions. This will include confluences in entering a trade, exit levels and risk management.</p><h2>Scalping</h2>
                <p>Involves taking trades that last for very short periods. A scalper can make many trades throughout the day. </p>
                <h2>Swing trading</h2>
                <p>In this case a trader holds trades for several days or weeks.</p>
                <h2>Automated trading</h2>
                <p>Automated trading involves the use of computer programs to execute trades. You can automate your trading using prebuilt Expert Advisors (EA's) or by writing your own EA's. You can also automate your trading by renting or buying bots. Let us have a look into the two options i.e. developing your own or considering commercialy available bots.</p>  
                <h3>MetaQutoes language 4 (MQL 4) and MetaQuotes language 5 (MQL 5)</h3>
                <p>If you wish to develop your own bots, consider using Expert Advisors for Meta Trader 4 and Meta Trader 5 platforms. MT4 and MT5 platforms have an integrated development environment for writing your own trading robots. MQL 4 and MQL 5 are coding languages for MT4 and MT5 platforms that allow traders to write their own trading strategies and indicators.</p>
